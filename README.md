## Laravel Markdown Blog
An example blog application using Laravel and Markdown - the right way.


**Why I've done this ?**
Basically I love to write blog articles on my DevsEnv - https://devsenv.com website by Laravel which uses **Tiny MCE Editor**, but I'm not satisfied with that. I believe, using **Markdown** is just a much better way to write blog articles.

### Versions
1. PHP - `^7.3|^8.0`
2. Laravel - `^8.75`

### External packages, I used
1. Laravel Markdown Parser - https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-Markdown
1. JavaScript Markdown Editor - https://github.com/sparksuite/simplemde-markdown-editor

### How to Start
```php
## Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/ManiruzzamanAkash/laravel-markdown-blog.git

## Install composer
composer install

## Install node, as we've used Tailwind CSS
npm install

## Run tailwind CSS in watch mode to change file
npm run watch
```
